# Introduction to the Angular docs

Angular is an application-design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps.

These Angular docs help you learn and use the Angular framework and development platform, from your first application to optimizing complex single-page applications for enterprises. Tutorials and guides include downloadable examples to help you start your projects.

## Assumptions

These docs assume that you are already familiar with [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_overview), and some of the tools from the [latest standards](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/conflicting/Web/JavaScript/JavaScript_technologies_overview), such as [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) and [modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import). The code samples are written using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Most Angular code can be written with just the latest JavaScript, using [types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html) for dependency injection, and using [decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html) for metadata.
